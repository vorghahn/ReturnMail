ReturnMail -- Created by Verlange

ReturnMail is based on ForwardMail by Tageshi and also Postal.

It simply returns the mail and attachements to the original sender. It will prioritise using the default in-game return function if available.
If not it will retrieve the items, draft a new mail, attache the items and resend it.
This can be triggered by pressing the "Force Return" button inside each mail or by pressing the backwards arrow on the main mailbox view.
Holding 'Alt' or 'Shift' down whilst clicking acts as a modify and will draft but not send the reply allowing you to modify the return.

Known issue(s):
Trying to return a stack of items that also already exists in your bags will result in a partial stack of different quantity being returned. This is due to Blizzards design of automatically merging stacks when retrieving them.
